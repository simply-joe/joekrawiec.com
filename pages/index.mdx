# Joe Krawiec

Hey, I am currently an Analytics Engineer at Cypress.io. I enjoy working with data and enabling self-server customer analytics at scale in my professional career.
In my personal time you can find me enjoying nature with my family and friends, drinking a good cup of coffee, or seeking out my next entrepreneural adventure! Check out the Now page for what I am currently working on.
