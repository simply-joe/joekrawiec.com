# Now

I have called Boston _home_ on and off for almost all of last decade. After many good times and fond memories, it's time to say I'll see you soon. My time living in Boston is officially coming to a close.  

In additional to moving homes, I recently began a new journey in my professional career as an analytics engineer at [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/). This comes after a long and fulfilling time at [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) where I was fortunate enough to be apart to the transformation a publicly traded company!  

I am excited for my next adventures! Follow my [blog](/posts) for more updates to come!
