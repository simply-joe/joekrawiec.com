# Joe Krawiec

Hi there thanks for stoping by, my name is Joe! In my professional career, I'm an analytics engineer at [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) where I enjoy taking on data challenges and enabling self-server customer analytics to put my background of Economics-Finance to good use.
<br />
<br />
In my personal time you can find me enjoying nature with my family and friends, drinking a good cup of coffee, or seeking out my next entrepreneural adventure! 
Check out the Now page for what I am currently working on.
