# Joe Krawiec

Hi there thanks for stopping by, my name is Joe! 
<br />
<br />
I recently started a new journey as an analytics engineer at [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) after ~3 years at [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).
<br />
<br />
In my personal time you can find me enjoying nature with my family and friends, drinking a good cup of coffee, or seeking out my next entrepreneurial adventure! 
<br />
<br />
Check out the [Now](/now) page for what I am currently working on.<br />
